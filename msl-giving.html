            For this Giving Tuesday ladder competition, every donor who gives at least $10 through
            the official SMCM Giving Tuesday form using our MSL link pushes our chapter higher.
            Your gift supports student access to Maryland Student Legislature – travel, registration,
            training, and the work we do connecting campuses across the state.

          <p class="section-body">
            I’m serving as the Giving Tuesday Champion for the SMCM MSL Chapter
            because I’ve seen what this program does for students who never
            thought they’d speak in a chamber, write policy, or build coalitions
            beyond campus.
          </p>
          <p class="section-body">
            We’ve run the numbers. With our statewide connections across MSL
            delegations and support from alumni, friends, and fellow students,
            we can hit our ladder goals. But every single donor matters—especially
            yours.
          </p>
          <p class="section-body">
            If you’ve ever believed students should understand how democracy
            actually works—not just in a textbook—this is one direct, concrete
            way to make that happen.
