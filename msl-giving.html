              When you give through the official SMCM Giving Tuesday form using our MSL link, your gift

              Donations are tax-deductible as provided by law, and you’ll receive a receipt from the College.

              A single gift can mean one more student who can afford to travel, speak on the floor, and
              discover that their voice actually carries.

          <p class="section-body">
            I’m serving as the Giving Tuesday Champion for the SMCM MSL Chapter because I’ve seen what
            this program does for students who never thought they’d speak in a chamber, write policy, or
            build coalitions beyond campus.
          </p>
          <p class="section-body">
            With our statewide connections across MSL delegations and support from alumni, friends, and
            fellow students, we can hit our ladder goals. But every single donor matters—especially yours.
          </p>
          <p class="section-body">
            If you’ve ever believed students should understand how democracy actually works—not just in
            a textbook—this is one direct, concrete way to make that happen.
