# Contributing to the SMCM MSL Website

Thanks for your interest in improving the **Maryland Student Legislature – St. Mary’s College of Maryland Chapter** site.

This is a student-run project, so our time is limited, but contributions are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Report issues**  
  - Use GitHub Issues for broken links, layout problems, or incorrect information.
  - Include a clear description and, if possible, steps to reproduce the problem.

- **Suggest improvements**  
  - Open an issue for ideas (new pages, clearer wording, accessibility improvements, etc.).
  - Be specific about what you’d like to change and why.

- **Submit changes (Pull Requests)**  
  - Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
  - Keep changes focused (one logical change per PR).
  - Include a short explanation in the PR description.

## Style & Content

- Keep the tone **informative and professional**, consistent with a student organization.
- Do not publish sensitive or private information (phone numbers, personal emails, etc.).
- When in doubt, open an issue and ask first.

## Review Process

- Maintainers will review issues and pull requests as time permits.
- We may request changes or decline contributions that don’t fit the chapter’s goals or constraints.

By participating in this project, you agree to follow our **Code of Conduct**.
