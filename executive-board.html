            Student Legislature Chapter. It’s a running archive of executive boards over time, beginning
            with our founding leadership team.

            Our founding executive board helped bring MSL to campus, build the chapter’s structure, and
            represent SMCM in statewide sessions for the first time. Per Article VI, Amendment 2 was created 
            to facilitate the creation of the MSL SMCM Chapter and does not represent the proposed 
            blueprient for future governance of this chapter.
