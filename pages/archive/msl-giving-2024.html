            We’re not just debating in a vacuum. MSL sessions put students into a real legislative
            simulation rooted in Maryland policy. Your gift makes sure money is never the reason a
            student can’t participate. Thanks to the generosity of the statewide MSL organization,
            our chapter was able to attend this past Fall Special Session at UMD College Park, where
            we had an outstanding 11 members attend over the two-day event as a brand-new chapter.

          <h2>Why I’m Asking You to Back This</h2>
          <p class="section-body">
            I’m serving as the Giving Tuesday Champion for the SMCM MSL Chapter because I’ve seen what
            this program does for students who never thought they’d speak in a chamber, write policy, or
            build coalitions beyond campus. I am a firm believer that democracy works only when everyone 
            has the opportunity to participate; my purpose in creating this club was to empower others 
            in the legislative process, just as it once empowered me. 
          </p>
          <p class="section-body">
            With our statewide connections across MSL delegations and support from alumni, friends, and
            fellow students, we can hit our ladder goals. But every single donor matters—especially yours.
          </p>
          <p class="section-body">
            If you’ve ever believed students should understand how democracy actually works, not just in
            a textbook but in real-world issues, this is one direct, concrete way to make that happen. 
            We’ve even tied our ladder milestones to chapter-wide incentives to keep things fun as we climb.

          <h2>Every $10 Vote Moves Us Up the Ladder</h2>
          <p class="section-body">
            The Giving Tuesday ladder tracks <strong>votes</strong>, not just dollars. Each person who gives 
            at least <strong>$10</strong> casts <strong>one ladder vote</strong> for SMCM MSL. That means a single $10 gift
            genuinely helps us climb. This campaign is also the main way we’ll provide funds for our members’ 
            fees heading into the Spring session, so every vote directly supports students who want to be in the room.

              <li>
                <strong>Hit the leaderboard:</strong> Executive Board members will volunteer to take a 
                classic whipped-cream pie to the face at a chapter event.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Every $100 raised:</strong> Members will run a celebratory mile for every $100 
                we raise. We’ll track the total distance as a way of showing how far your support takes us.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Top 3 finish on the ladder:</strong> Willing members will take part in a safe, 
                supervised SMCM river plunge to celebrate the win.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1st place on the ladder:</strong> Unlocks a <strong>super secret chapter surprise</strong> 
                we’ll only reveal if we reach the top spot.

            <p class="small" style="margin-top:0.75rem;">
              All participation in these incentives is voluntary, and we’ll always prioritize safety and 
              campus guidelines while we celebrate.

          <div class="card plain-card">
            <h3>Your Vote, Your Impact</h3>
            <p class="small">
              Because the ladder is based on vote counts, not just large one-time gifts, 
              <strong>many small donors are just as powerful as a few big ones</strong>. If you’re able to give 
              at least $10, that single vote helps our delegation unlock funding for delegate fees, travel, 
              and programming for the Spring session.

            <p class="small">
              Whether you’re an alumnus, a friend, a family member, or a fellow student, your vote for 
              SMCM MSL tells our members that their voices are worth investing in.
